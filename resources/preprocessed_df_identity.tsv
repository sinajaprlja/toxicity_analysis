Advice	355	inheritance of father 's belongings , but not the home -- where does it all go ? hello . so , unfortunately my father died unexpectedly a couple months ago and left behind an * extensive * collection of vinyl and books . i 'm talking upwards of 1000 records and possibly even more books . i tasked myself with cataloging the records , which has been enjoyable sometimes to get to see some of the taste of music my dad was into . however , we are not able to retain the home and it will probably go into foreclosure by the end of the year . also , something about home insurance is set to expire at the end of the month , and we ca n't act to even pay the insurance since it 's in my dad 's name . there currently only exists a copy of his will , as we 're having great difficulty finding the original -- creating obstacles of its own kind . out of my siblings , i 'm the only one really interested in any of the records , but all of us want to keep his books not only for the rare editions he has , but also because i guess that 's what we remember our dad doing most : reading -- and i suppose i speak for myself when i say i want to try and trace his literary footsteps . i 'm still in college and have no practical way to transport the records or even have a permanent residence that i can move these belongings into . along with the records , my dad left me some great stereo equipment and turntables . i love this stuff and remember using it with him , but i do n't know where / how to keep any of it until i have a home i can furnish these in . if i wanted to get a storage unit , it 'd have to be temperature controlled because of the vinyl and that 's more money that i do n't have . i understand it 's probably impractical to keep all the records and have considered donating books / records to local coffee shops . i ca n't stand the thought of discarding or throwing these things away , but i do n't know how i can keep them .	0.19241629540920258	0.45632702112197876	0.05739210918545723	0.01753227412700653	0.03852438926696777	0.028755133971571922	0.03779397904872894	0.02258310094475746	0.019122101366519928	0.01868612691760063	0.029783591628074646	0.022251512855291367	0.028655562549829483	0.030176814645528793

Advice	336	what to do about struggling to fit in at uni ? ( m ) i started uni this year and the first two weeks were alright with me thinking my flatmates and people they were hanging out with were okayish and i could find people who are more like me to hang out with while not having a problem with my flatmates . but my course has quite a small amount of people and there are no events for it so i only really know 1 or 2 people and i have been stuck with my flatmates and their friends for the whole year . one of them is a nice enough guy who would be fine in a group of friends but alone it just is n't much fun . the other people in that group i mentioned are all in my opinion annoying and loud ( in a bad way ) whilst also having a sense of fun and humour that is nothing like mine . and i 'm not a boring person !

AskReddit	399	what can i do to help my mom ? hey reddit , throwaway ( used for another purpose here . ) so i am currently 21 years old and live on my own . i have been on my own going to college for about 2 years now - making ends meet fine .. not living beyond my means , lots of student debt but no credit cards .. all that fun stuff . occasionally i have found myself in need of cash for car repairs , emergency bills , etc . and my mom has always been there to help . she works a laborious job - long hours , shitty factory work - but makes enough to get by herself as well as support my sister who is in high school . i just found out that since the company she works for has been losing business she will be layed off in two weeks . this coming when she was trying to finally get all of her own debt paid , correct her mistakes and move on with her life ( after a divorce that left her with all the debt and bills for paying for my sister . ) she is not a greedy person . she has no interest in seeing , talking to or sueing her ex - husband . she just wants to move on but does n't even have a car good enough to get her 30 miles - which is how far she would have to go from our small town to the only town big enough in the area to have a wal - mart . i have been taking as many freelance jobs as i can trying to get some money together to get her a vehicle for christmas so she at least has a chance - but what else can i do ? i am a college student -video production and have been trying to get more work , sell dvds for $ 5 of my shitty first short film(mostly to family for the purpose of raising money to help my mom ) but i do n't think i will be able to pull it off . i am not making enough extra cash . so what would be smart ? get a car loan ? donate plasma ? try and take out more student loan money?(ugh ) basically any ventures and ideas are extremely welcome - i am 21 and i have plenty of my life to pay off debt so i am willing to take on more if it means helping my mom .	0.6653624773025513	0.17769408226013184	0.011148154735565186	0.007181540131568909	0.011120193637907505	0.027219844982028008	0.013814057223498821	0.01694595441222191	0.015113298781216145	0.0057058255188167095	0.012295623309910297	0.007510549854487181	0.010132395662367344	0.018755963072180748

( not compound fractures , but obviously still plenty of pain ) i thought it would end up a badass story to tell , but when i went to the er and had the x rays done , nurses gathered around to laugh and take pictures of the x ray of the kid with two broken arms . already upset , that night i got hungry and tried to get myself a midnight snack . i could n't open the fucking fridge . the next day at school , i received everything but pity or compassion . i had been on the baseball team . i was cool . but kids are fucking relentless . nobody signed my casts . since then , i largely kept to myself . i had quit the baseball team , and spent more time with my real friends . i now know i 'm not special , but i do my best to make other people feel that they belong . belonging is the closest thing to special there is .	0.15463091433048248	0.4847599267959595	0.04042506963014603	0.024764472618699074	0.05311739072203636	0.04135366901755333	0.028594499453902245	0.03344881162047386	0.017330531030893326	0.02794862724840641	0.030319612473249435	0.021417107433080673	0.02023073472082615	0.02165861986577511

AskReddit	212	why do you think young guys wear their pants so low ? immediately , everyone wants to say its because they 're idiots , but i 'd wager there 's more to it than that . i knew a guy who wore his pants like that , and he was not someone i considered to be very concerned with his image . he said it was just so much more comfortable that way , and he ca n't figure out how people wear them normally . i tried to wear it low but it did n't work for me . my theory ? get ready , its a weird one . when people are stressed they take that stress out on certain muscles by flexing it constantly without realizing it . certain cultures seem to favor stress - muscle - areas more than others . white american culture seems to take everything out on their lower back , pooching their stomachs out and creating an overly alert torso . these lowered pants belong to a counter culture that , i believe , has complete relaxation of the lower back as one if its principles ( though , probably completely unsaid ) . the stress they feel , i believe , is transferred more to the shoulder / upper torso area . i suspect that the posture formed by this counter reaction to common tense - back posture makes wearing pants like that much more desirable .	0.001809793757274747	0.8761380910873413	0.004799127113074064	0.002765773795545101	0.00535942055284977	0.003081762930378318	0.07949215918779373	0.003269143868237734	0.0018270339351147413	0.005178946070373058	0.007645362056791782	0.0023860095534473658	0.0024452332872897387	0.0038021085783839226

AskReddit	254	did the navy discriminate against my so ? my so ( 20 m ) decided he wanted to join the navy , so we went to a recruiting office to get info and such . he had searched previously on the web about disqualifications before going as he was nervous ... i think since about end of middle school he was diagnosed with add , and was prescribed medication for it and until recently would always take it to focus in school . he really has n't been taking it as often in his college classes lately and is doing fine . anyways , he was open with the recruiter and he flat out denied him . he even called his management person ( i do n't know the official names obviously ) and he said he would have to be off of it for 6 months to 1 year or more and have a cleared doctors note to even start the process . at first i did n't think anything wrong with that order and we figured he could just lie about it and say he 's been off it long enough and get a doctor 's note if he 's confident he will be okay . two days later when i mentioned this to a friend they got a little heated and said it was considered discrimination and illegal . i do n't know anything about the navy but i support my boyfriend and want him to succeed in what he wants to do . * * are they entitled to that decision to deny him , or was it illegal and a form of discrimination ?	0.009423820301890373	0.9150182008743286	0.005831466056406498	0.002826396841555834	0.0119426678866148	0.02121468260884285	0.006563873030245304	0.005342176184058189	0.0051309214904904366	0.004036808852106333	0.0037097802851349115	0.002915904624387622	0.0036422729026526213	0.0024012234061956406

AskReddit	356	does anyone have any ideas on how i can watch super 15 rugby in the us ? ok , so heres the deal . there used to be this site called rugbyzone.com that had the rights to super 14 , trinations , currie cup , air new zealand cup , and a few other tournaments . you bought a membership to watch a tournament , and they had live streaming and archives of all the games . all was well in the rugby universe . however , this year rugbyzone for whatever reason did n't get the rights to broadcast super 15 and has shut down . setanta is another service very similar to rugbyzone , but fox soccer plus bought out setanta 's us site , and now fox soccer does n't have the rights to super 15 either . it appears that sanzar ( rugby committee ) have sold the rights to direct tv for us broadcasting of super 15 rugby , which is strange as hell because usually rights go to a broadcaster , not a provider . i do not have direct tv , and have no way of getting it so it seems like all my options have dried up . my thoughts : - i can hope that torrents will be put up of the games . i 'm not too confident in this though . there are torrents for last years super 14 games , but i 'm not sure how quickly they got added , and how many seeders there will be . -proxies . setanta asia has super 15 . i ve messed around with it a little bit , but if i use a hong kong proxy , setanta thinks i 'm in asia . my biggest issue with this is that since the videos are streamed , i think the video will stop every 3 seconds to buffer , and basically be unwatchable . -p2p and other sites that will live stream the games . this would be an awesome solution , but unfortunately i need an archive . the games are played at around 2 - 6 am est , and i do need sleep . so basically , i turn to you reddit . i 'm willing to pay to watch the games , but there simply is no option i 'm aware of . does anyone have any internet magic , or any advice ? thanks .	0.13289932906627655	0.24953512847423553	0.03729656711220741	0.05553188547492027	0.06381052732467651	0.18267105519771576	0.06653004139661789	0.03253360837697983	0.026313183829188347	0.013233346864581108	0.021194815635681152	0.04732957482337952	0.03465709835290909	0.03646385669708252

AskReddit	301	how can i get rid of a car without it being in my name ? hi /r / askreddit here 's the deal : when i graduated high school , my parents bought me a used car as a gift . extremely generous of them , but after 7 years , the car is in bad shape . rusted out brakelines among other things have made the car more trouble than its worth , and it 's now time to get rid of it . i 've actually already purchased a replacement for it ( the thing had no trade in value ) , and the only remaining question is how i 'm going to get rid of the old one . let me be clear , the car , for all intents and purposes , was mine . i was the only one who drove it . i paid for everything related to maintenance and insurance . unfortunately , my parents bought it and the title is in my father 's name . he and i do not speak . the story is long and absurd , but to get a general idea of what he 's like , head on over to /r / raisedbynarcissists . now , i have to get rid of the car , but i ca n't actually do anything with it since it is n't in my name . i 've swallowed my pride and attempted to discuss the issue with my dad , but he 's unwilling to transfer the car into my name so that i can deal with it . my question for you is this : is there any way for me to legally dispose of the car without having the title in my name ? can i donate it or take it to a scrap yard without having to show proof of ownership ? also fyi , i live in pennsylvania , so i 'm sure there are state laws in place that would impact my options . i appreciate your help in advance .	0.23903776705265045	0.44417092204093933	0.05742167308926582	0.02839515544474125	0.029009787365794182	0.0170749481767416	0.03107968345284462	0.022650880739092827	0.014035061933100224	0.030804211273789406	0.03812642768025398	0.01618187688291073	0.013980167917907238	0.018031364306807518

[ x - post from r / relationships ] did n't get much help from r / relationships except the whole man up bullshit . anyway , here 's the story got intimate with a married colleague about a year ago and things were going smooth . sex was great and we shared this intense love for each other . being in a financially vulnerable position , she used to help me out too . a couple of months later we change workplaces and still continue the relationship whenever we could . fast forward to two months ago , i join her company and she 's suddenly acting quite distant . in the previous place , we used to take little breaks every now and then to make out in the elevator . i confront her about this and she says she does n't want to get physical now , citing problems with family and so on . i agree , although with a lot of disappointment . and it went on , she never said that it was a total stoppage and just temporary . but then afterwards she slowly tries to shut me out , not responding to me on fb , not wanting to hang out and so on yet still very warm and friendly to others . and i also observed that she 's talking obsessively to some new guy on fb . so yesterday , i sort of get very upset and breaks off with her through a pm and i wish her happiness with her new interest . but then she replies that she was sorry that it was her problems that prevented her from giving me the required intimacy and denied that she had anything to do with that guy from fb . i think its bullshit because it is so obvious that she was taking an effort to ignore me and it was like she was talking to him all the time while ignoring me . it can either be a married woman 's sick game or a genuine reason , but i was n't going to suffer being sidelined and watch as she slowly drifted away . so reddit , please tell me how to deal with it . i really love her and would like to hit restart .	0.7667843103408813	0.10684413462877274	0.011862761341035366	0.004797698464244604	0.011440922506153584	0.009868111461400986	0.01062856987118721	0.006676637101918459	0.005225426983088255	0.010718224570155144	0.03987753763794899	0.0028836748097091913	0.004675651900470257	0.007716252002865076
Cooking	173	is there anything i can do to contain the chopped onion smell in my fridge ? i hate chopping onions . i do n't think anyone * likes * it but when i do it i usually end up in the bathroom for a bit afterward cleaning myself up because my eyes explode . because of this , if i need less than a whole onion for a recipe i 'll chop the whole thing in one go and then save the unused part in the fridge . for me this is win - win : i get to have onion easily on hand , i do n't have to chop as often and deal with aforementioned tear explosion . this probably is n't the best way to eat onions and i 'm probably ruining flavor or something but i 'm happy with my process .... except that it makes my fridge stink of onion . a half of a chopped onion in a ziplock bag will waft onion stink into your face as soon as you open the door . is there anything to be done about this ?	0.3855572044849396	0.25759807229042053	0.07339731603860855	0.01499710138887167	0.03299262374639511	0.032391976565122604	0.026256944984197617	0.037891119718551636	0.017393209040164948	0.019771317020058632	0.02569141611456871	0.01724829338490963	0.023014197126030922	0.035799313336610794
Dogtraining	262	"need help with neighbor 's dog hi folks , i 'm hoping that some of you who have some training experience can help me with this situation . our friendly neighbors got a german shepherd puppy a while back . we were very excited , as the people who lived there before had a dog who was bff with our pooch . this dog , however , has a very different temperament , very spooky , barks and growls at everything and everyone . one of our early encounters with the dog involved our son playing in our fenced front yard ; as the dog was being walked past , she attempted to come over the fence to get at my kid . not in a friendly "" hey let 's play ! "" way , but in a tail down , growling , "" i want to kill you "" way . it was scary . but the biggest issue is that the dog has access to a part of their yard that is right next to our front porch . the fence there ( which belongs to the neighbors ) is only 3 feet high , so the dog is about half over it when she stands up . which of course she does , while barking ferociously , at everyone who comes to the door . the mailman has skipped our house a few times because of this . and she 's scared a fair number of visitors to death . i 've managed to get her to the point where she at least no longer growls at me by feeding her treats , but obv this is n't an option for every single person who comes to the door . sorry , this is kinda"	0.3384997844696045	0.11913873255252838	0.09240702539682388	0.03096667118370533	0.0776539072394371	0.04253661632537842	0.06486157327890396	0.04711170494556427	0.023683913052082062	0.031798429787158966	0.02516677975654602	0.036641888320446014	0.029782528057694435	0.03975043445825577
Dogtraining	314	wolf hybrid not responding to mouthing training hey , i have a 7.5 month old wolfdog ( siberian husky mother , malamute / mid content timberwolf father ) . there 's no way to know his actual content without a dna test , but he rests somewhere between 15 - 35 % . his appearance suggests a lot of wolf expression in the genes . he did n't come to me in the best of shape , but i 've had him for a few months now and his training is coming along nicely . fuck people who crate puppies for 8 or more hours a day , though . the biggest problem i have with him right now is that he enjoys mouthing . his adult teeth are almost fully formed , so obviously this is going to become a problem . he has not responded well to any of the scenarios i have set up to train him out of mouthing , or any of the various techniques / approaches i 've tried . for the record , this dog will never be hit or intimidated ; i do take food and fun away from him to control him in as aggressive a manner as i need to be effective , but never will i touch him aggressively . his biggest problem is during play , as while chewing / eating / gnawing on something he is generally fine , and while calm he 'll boop you with his nose or lick you before he opens his mouth . but while playing he tries to grab with his mouth to drag you down which is pretty natural large breed / wolf play . unfortunately , that shit does n't look good and i 've been trying to teach him how to play safely and politely to little avail . his focus , recall , and sit stay are phenomenal . his down / down stay is getting there , but he still needs to be led in to the position . if anyone has suggestions on these more serious mouthing problems , or wolf behavior in general , i 'd appreciate a second opinion .	0.0361388735473156	0.5822230577468872	0.05721054598689079	0.048624079674482346	0.05872588977217674	0.015790287405252457	0.041556891053915024	0.02179061621427536	0.02755896747112274	0.016361277550458908	0.011255939491093159	0.014716818928718567	0.03816675394773483	0.02988002635538578

Pets	318	cats bullying new cat in home hey all . about a month ago , my wife and i got a new 1 1/2 year old snowshoe cat from a friend who said she needed to get rid of him . we brought him home and kept him secluded on his own for about 2 weeks . then we began to introduce them all and let him roam on his own . well , our youngest cat has no issues with him . however , our three oldest males are having issues . ( all are fixed . ) the new arrival , named jj , seems very intimidated by the cats we already have , except for the 6 month old , and cowers whenever they are near which causes them to harass and swat at him . ( not violently to draw blood , but it scares him greatly . ) the old water bottle then comes into play against the harassers . we then put jj back in his old room and let him calm down . we 're greatly confused by this . i 've introduced dozens of cats and never had this issue . jj , the new cat , does seem very skiddish and scared of noises and growls whenever he hears people outside or if we pick him up for too long . we bought a feliway plug - in and a feliway spray bottle should arrive soon . we have also been putting the food near the door when he 's locked up and we swap out beds and toys to spread the scent . ( jj does get locked up at night to be safe . ) can anyone offer advice on how to stop this ? we know the prior owner had 2 loud kids and a big , exciteable dog . is jj 's nervousness causing them to antagonize him because they sense his fear ? i would hate to have to find him a new home , but it 's been about a month now since we got him and i 've seen no improvement as of yet .	0.04919604957103729	0.7476205825805664	0.024084730073809624	0.015173740684986115	0.018156662583351135	0.017696667462587357	0.020986134186387062	0.019738612696528435	0.011770118027925491	0.012996003031730652	0.009709772653877735	0.012053065001964569	0.020027240738272667	0.02079077623784542

askwomenadvice	391	i 'm worried that i 'm inadvertently intimidating women on my usual walk to work through isolated areas . i need some advice regarding how i should handle something that 's really starting to bother me . i 'm 28 , 6'3 , bearded and overweight . ( why i gave the extra stats will make sense further down ) every morning and evening i walk from my flat to my tram stop . this walk is a little odd as it takes me down a fairly poorly lit canal and under a couple of quite low bridges . being a canal it 's sunk below most of the surrounding area with hills either side making the route even more isolated . the fact it 's winter and usually dark when i 'm walking this route is also a factor . i 've known for a while that sometimes people feel uncomfortable down on that route , due to women often looking over there shoulders several times when i 'm walking the same route , taking their headphones out and clutching their bags etc . it really came to a head a couple of days ago , when i was walking a little bit faster then a women , went to pass her and she took off running while randomly looking back at me . this is n't all women on this route , but i walk it twice a day , 5 days a week , and this usually happens about once a week . ( the person obviously being uncomfortable i mean , the sprinting away from me was a first ) i 've tried to take reasonable steps not to worry people . making sure to keep a reasonable distance , only overtaking people when they 're stopped or walking really slowly , but i think this makes my actions look overly deliberate and come off as even more creepy . i know the women involved are doing nothing wrong in being aware of their surroundings and the fact i 'm a large guy walking down what is essentially a dark alley . but it 's starting to get to me , as no one likes to scare people , and i always feel awful afterwards . is there anything i can do to make myself less intimidating in this situation . i 'm open to wearing a high vis vest or a bell at this point . and oh god , i read back my question and realised i sound like a sexual predator asking for tips to be more unassuming . aaaargh !	0.06280285120010376	0.751264750957489	0.03555590286850929	0.011226835660636425	0.037155475467443466	0.015964217483997345	0.012953848578035831	0.013620606623589993	0.012585285119712353	0.00940082035958767	0.008595776744186878	0.009153175167739391	0.008954280987381935	0.010766168124973774

dating_advice	324	girl keeps blowing off our dates but still seems interested . what do ? so we had a great first date about 3 weeks ago , she even initiated the kiss . we have great text conversations every other day and she seems genuinely interested . after that first date i asked her out several times to which she agreed , then the day of the date she texts me some reason why she ca n't go . it started off with her being sick , np i understand . next up was an all of a sudden beach day with her family . ok cool family over np . next time was she had a bunch of homework she needed to catch up on . this is when i think to myself wtf , but oh well i 'll forget about it . then her best friends car broke down and i came out to help . she did n't know i came and i ended up taking both of them to dinner . it 's like 10:30pm at this point and ask if she wants to go get some ice cream just us two and she said she 's going to follow her friend home to make sure she gets home safely . understandable . we had a date tonight and she texts me this morning saying she 's just people'd out right now . i kinda understand cause of family from thanksgiving and apparently she 's been spending a lot of time with her best friend and just wants some time to herself . so i 'm at the point of wondering if this just is n't working out . but on the flip side she 's having these 2 + hour conversations with me at night and we really seem to click . i 'm friends with her best friend too and her friend says she 's into me . so i 'm probably just being paranoid but i mean ... if we 're going to go out , you have to make time to see me at least once every now and then , right ?	0.8897018432617188	0.0076303849928081036	0.007298852317035198	0.0039830454625189304	0.0062811365351080894	0.007557481061667204	0.005856512580066919	0.008751248009502888	0.0024030145723372698	0.012144429609179497	0.02117990329861641	0.010096852667629719	0.0049863168969750404	0.012129048816859722
dating_advice	260	just broke up with my girlfriend of two years , really interested in another girl . when can i make my move ? background : so my ex and me have just broke up , i feel a little sad , but mostly relieved . but now i got another problem on my neck . as i mentioned in the previous post , i have a really strong interest in this other girl in my ex 's class . like i want to talk to her all the time and get to know her better . i have asked some friends about advice , some of them think i should write to her on facebook in maybe a week or two weeks time , but to be discrete and not let her know that i am intersted in her . another says that i should tell her how i feel but wait some time to go out with her , becuase the thing is that i am worried that she will get interested in someone else if i wait to long . but it does n't feel morally right to go out with a girl in my ex 's class just a few days after we broke up . what is best to do ? send her a pm on fb in a couple of weeks and try to start a conversation , or tell her how i feel right now ? she always says hi and crack big smiles when she sees me , so she is showing some interest in me atleast .. she also added me on fb a while back . any advie would be much appreciated !	0.6139817833900452	0.2524089813232422	0.014239689335227013	0.005728218704462051	0.015260455198585987	0.010817589238286018	0.014143893495202065	0.011600122787058353	0.005547693464905024	0.01609930768609047	0.01686091348528862	0.006166407372802496	0.00998455099761486	0.007160418666899204

"" i sat with her during the wedding and we talked a little bit but after the wedding she bolted . did n't stay for the reception or say bye . she texted me later saying it was good to see me and sorry for not saying bye . anyways now we have been talking for a few weeks and it seems as if she 's into me . i really like her and if i ask her out on a date i was just wondering how to approach it . as a 3rd date or start over as if it was the 1st . she seems to prefer texting as her primary form of communication which i do too . also i asked her out earlier this week but she said she had a cold and was n't sure how she would feel later but said she definitely wants to go out some time . so how do i ask her out again without sounding too pushy and should i call her to set up the next date ? we 've only spoken through texts so far and if i just called to ask her out i would n't exactly know what to say , i guess just give her details for a possible date and then hang up ?"	0.7817043662071228	0.1027550920844078	0.01099003478884697	0.006000050809234381	0.007962965406477451	0.01220002956688404	0.006865713745355606	0.0077212839387357235	0.012195681221783161	0.010670831426978111	0.02362995222210884	0.004765660967677832	0.006875268649309874	0.005663126707077026

offmychest	395	i feel humiliated . i am returning to my university for half of a 5th year . during my time here at school i held a position which inadvertently had me working 10 + hours that i would get paid for , which i did ; without question . i worked really hard to have everything work at my job . at the end of this year i decided to leave the position and apply to step down to a front desk position . about a month ago , i was brought into my bosses office and was reamed for other people doing my job , and not being prepared for events we were putting on . in actuality people began taking care of all my duties to try and impress my current boss , so they would get hired , and we were n't prepared to host the events because my boss kept putting off hiring new staff and volunteers ( something which i can not do ) . i sort of reamed into my boss , and brought up everything that i thought was going wrong . anyway , this week they were hiring for the new positions and i decided it would be best if i did n't apply for the position , seeing as i had just essentially told my boss she was n't doing her job effectively enough for me to do mine . but she approached me and had set aside an interview time for me anyway ( before i had submitted an application or resume ) , telling me she thought i could still be really helpful behind the desk , ushering in the new student staff . so i killed the interview , and was even told during the interview by the panel that i was doing very well . today my boss walked up to me while at work , in front of my peers and some friends saying i did n't get the job . * * what the fuck . * * how to i go into work the rest of the year knowing that i was set up in this interview so that they could tell me no . how can i continue working for this department after i was set up to fail like that . i have given 3 years of my college career to help this department and they ca nt keep me on to help the department i have skipped classes , practices , and even numerous dates for . please tell me reddit , how do i face that tomorrow ?	0.42144328355789185	0.2028394490480423	0.03672321140766144	0.027462271973490715	0.048529624938964844	0.06445590406656265	0.03309086710214615	0.025230957195162773	0.02196252904832363	0.01615980453789234	0.018211444839835167	0.03681362420320511	0.02212527021765709	0.02495180256664753
offmychest	393	i 'm going to break up with him , just so i 'm available in case the guy who shattered my heart has any desire to date me . in all fairness , i am only dating my boyfriend because i felt insanely alone and desperate . i have minimal physical attraction for him , and my ability to put up with him is waning . he 's a great guy , and he 's certainly in love with me , but it just is n't worth it . the guy i like , however , is great to talk to , and is absolutely stunning . while he 's a lot less mature ( 16 , while my boyfriend is 19 ) he 's more in tune with what i talk about , as we are in the same grade , with mostly similar classes , we both run , and we both are in ski club . but , i can never tell if he would want me to be more than a friend . last year , he was a complete flirt . everyone who saw how we acted with one another was sure we would become a couple . he admitted to one of my friends that he liked me , but was n't ready for a relationship , so i did n't want to ask him out . eventually he asked out another girl , but continued to flirt with me . he still is a complete flirt , but now it 's a lot more verbal than physical , because he knows i have a boyfriend . now , i just want to say , he has broken up with his past two girlfriends because they did n't want to do much more than hug , which is understandable , i mean , he is a 16 year old guy , what more can you expect ? he and i are very open with each other , which involves us letting each other go through our phones , even texts , during lunch . note , we both have iphones , so our lives are on there . this is how he found out that i 've slept with my boyfriend , when i think he wrote me off as one of those girls that would n't do something like that . because of that though , i think he thinks i prefer my boyfriend over him , and i do not want to be sending the wrong impression . and we are starting to talk a lot , so i feel i might have a chance with him if it did n't seem like he was n't important to me .	0.14048852026462555	0.7393215298652649	0.010641622357070446	0.005170684307813644	0.007810184732079506	0.00963123794645071	0.007267666980624199	0.008916350081562996	0.004648889414966106	0.015735633671283722	0.02605871669948101	0.005386994685977697	0.0074174911715090275	0.01150447130203247

relationships	351	me [ 19 ] self - destructive obsessive behavior . hello , thanks for reading . i 've been trying to get a ton of my problems under control lately , and this is a huge one i 've noticed . i have this self - destructive tendency to obsess over someone that i 'm romantically associated with . usually this does n't happen until i * actually * love them , but it turns into a huge problem . i 'll use an example to show you what i mean . i 've known a girl for about a year now , and she 's one of the best people i 've ever met . she 's a great friend , and i started to show interest in her a while ago . she 's interested in me too , and it sort of snowballed from there . fast forward a bit , and i love her now . suddenly , i feel horrible . i used to be extremely happy while being around her all the time . now , i obsess over it and ca n't feel happy . i constantly want to talk to the person because their attention means so much to me , but i know i ca n't do that . i respectfully try not to turn into some overly - attached guy , and that kills me . i worry that she hates me ( despite knowing that she does n't ) . i really worry when she disappears for a couple of days with no contact , and obsessively think about her not wanting to talk to me ( or yeah , hating me ) . it ends up ruining everything , and i know none of it is logical . it has happened * every single time * . i have to stress that i 'm really not exaggerating here either . the obsessive thoughts turn into pure agony . it 's like my own personal hell . i * know * she does n't hate me . i * know * she 's allowed time to herself and probably does n't want to talk to me all the time ( hell , i do n't want to talk to her all the time either ) and yet my mind goes into auto - pilot and starts making me feel terrible . i really do n't know what to do to break this cycle . i do n't want it to ruin something good again . sorry if i sound insane :/	0.7023897767066956	0.11696688830852509	0.03697642683982849	0.005854784045368433	0.013471808284521103	0.017669500783085823	0.017812512814998627	0.011887690983712673	0.00960913673043251	0.010066887363791466	0.021093295887112617	0.006209508515894413	0.00813736580312252	0.02185443788766861
relationships	379	my [ 23 m ] housemate [ 27 m ] is addicted to meth . my [ 23 m ] housemate [ 27 m ] of one year is addicted to meth . long story short i co signed a lease with bob who i later found out is addicted to meth . the landlords live next door . for a short while i tried to help bob quit meth . we deleted the phone numbers of his meth dealers , smashed a crack pipe together and dumped a whole boot load of needles at the local disposal place in the middle of the night . it did n't work , he picked up new equipment and relapsed . he buys street meth and refines it using diy lab equipment . from what i recall , this process involves dissolving the meth in isopropalalcohol , washing it in acetone and then letting the acetone evaporate leaving a more pure version of meth . i 'm a little uncomfortable with having a micro meth refinery in the house i live in but my options seem limited . i do nt have the money to move at the moment . i am super poor and somehow managed to find a place that costs $ 70 a week even though i am 5 mins on the train from the city . i ca nt afford the capital cost of moving but i also ca nt afford a 50 % increase in rent that i would likely have to pay for a similar place . i also do nt see a way to get him to move out aside from snitching on him to the landlords / police which i 'm unwilling to do . he also loves this place . i think his dedication to giving up meth is a bit too variable for long term success to be plausible at this time . perhaps with long term support he can break free of addiction but my dedication to helping him also waivers . i have a university degree to focus on not failing . i do nt want to abandon him in what seems like his hour of need but at the same time i want my home to be a sanctuary away from other peoples problems . i also fear that the landlords will eventually discover he is addicted to meth and that will cause me great troubles of my own since we are both on the lease .	0.06270793080329895	0.8363834023475647	0.011112013831734657	0.004200954455882311	0.011666589416563511	0.013623873703181744	0.010901895351707935	0.0073003629222512245	0.005821718834340572	0.005223870277404785	0.01186363399028778	0.003294023685157299	0.004614503588527441	0.011285323649644852

relationships	392	29 / m with 28 / f for 2.5 years - the relationship is ending , what is the best way to handle this ? this is somewhat of an update to [ this post ] it took me a few more weeks of broken promises and realizing she is not really ever going to do anything to help herself , but i am finally leaving her and would love to hear some advice on what you think the ideal way is to handle the situation . it 's my first long - term relationship , we live together and were engaged , but i can see now that her issues are not something she wants to work on , and i suffer for it . some issues i will struggle with : 1 ) we live together , and i have to find my own place now . i ca n't really stay with anyone while i look because i moved away from family , and my life revolved ( unhealthily ) around her . so i 'm now staying in our spare bedroom while i look for roomshares . i plan to be out within a couple of weeks hopefully . sound reasonable ? 2 ) she does n't want me to leave her , and will likely do her best to manipulate me into staying by promising to do xyz that she has promised a hundred times and never does . best way to fight this mental torture ? 3 ) i feel a sense of freedom and hope in being able to pursue my interests again , and maybe find someone special that i can trust and start a family with without any doubts , but i also feel a sense of loss and loneliness . i worry that this feeling will cause me to think irrationally and go back to her . it probably ties in with # 2 as well . any tips ? 4 ) how should i treat her while this is going on ? since we 're still living together for now , i may have to interact with her occasionally . i do n't hate her , i just ca n't deal with the drama and lack of trust anymore . i do n't want to be fighting and spewing out all of my frustration and anger towards her because it just is n't worth it anymore , but if she starts trying to talk to me about fixing things and staying there , i do n't know what i will do . 5 ) any general tips or things you wish you had done ? thanks !	0.3634790778160095	0.46509990096092224	0.020914670079946518	0.006769506726413965	0.009308230131864548	0.010927403345704079	0.014410666190087795	0.011850317940115929	0.020705046132206917	0.015456089749932289	0.046153631061315536	0.004682967439293861	0.005169189069420099	0.005073369015008211

relationships	386	what should i do regarding my interest ( 21f ) still wanting to be friends after she rejected me ( 20 m ) ? i need some advice . there 's this girl that i like , who is aware of my feelings for her , but is in love with another guy ( a friend of mine ) that has a girlfriend at the moment . from my understanding , he 's unhappy in his relationship , but does n't want to leave the girlfriend just yet since he went through so much pursuing the girlfriend in the first place and would feel bad just leaving her . my predicament , is that the girl i like still wants to be my friend and wants to talk to me and spend time with me everyday the same as before she rejected my romantic feelings for her . i do want to be her friend , but i feel that we need to spend less time together . although i 've asked for some space in the past , she 's made me feel guilty about it saying that she needs a friend who wo n't place restrictions on the friendship , so i 've kind of given in to her . i feel like she is right in saying that if i want to be her friend , i should n't want to push her away . but it 's hard having to see her everyday and not feel drawn to her romantically , though i 'm aware that the dynamic of our relationship will never change , because of her love for this guy . this guy has known her for 3 years and has had feelings for her since , but because she had a boyfriend at the time , he kept his distance and chased after other girls ( hence the fact that he now has a girlfriend -- they only started dating late last fall ) . more background : she and i only started hanging out when she invited me out to see a musical performance with her . from then , we started talking and at first she showed a strong interest in me even bluntly saying that she likes me . but after a good 2 months of getting to know each other , the truth came out that she loves someone else . she still wants to hang out and be friends , but every now and then she 'll say she 's confused about how she feels ( without any prompting from me ) .	0.8063745498657227	0.053111493587493896	0.01679350435733795	0.007171031087636948	0.012462363578379154	0.015057491138577461	0.012135712429881096	0.010044071823358536	0.00738325621932745	0.01718616858124733	0.020473232492804527	0.005285351071506739	0.00851257424801588	0.008009144105017185

relationships	391	my boyfriend [ 20 m ] broke up with me [ 18f ] and i 'm spiralling into something awful . i 've created a throwaway account specifically for this post . as a quick look into my background before i get to the main issue , i 've suffered from fluctuating depression for the past 3 years which has been on different scales of severity . i 've experienced break ups before but they have either been from loveless relationships or ones where the love has dwindled . 4 months ago i met my most recent ex and at first i struggled to develop feelings for him , which created issues . then i did get the feelings and i fell in love with him and he became my perfect constant . we were so happy i could n't believe it . he kept me steady whilst my alevel exams were pushing me off slightly and he was genuinely the nicest guy i had ever met . recently , and this probably relates to his moving away to uni , i started to slip back into depression and because of this i became more argumentative . in one week we had 4 arguments over fickle things which i did n't consider too bad and always managed to sort it within the day , then when i visited him this weekend just gone he explained that he 's been having doubts because of the arguments and that he was staying with me not because he wanted to , but because of my mental health issues . we argued , again . made up , again . he talked to me about the future and about seeing me on christmas day etc then the next day dumped me over text . i am distraught . i want him back like something not right but he has his mind set on staying apart despite still loving me . my main issue is that my education is going downhill and i have very few close real friends so i 'm not finding any comfort . my doctor has recently prescribed me antidepressants but the side effect list has scared me from taking them . i am lost . i want him back with such sheer desperation and i feel as though my constant is gone and i have no way to comfort myself because of the non - relationship issue . i do n't know what i hope to achieve by posting this . i need help . apologies for any possible spelling errors .	0.17087909579277039	0.7379711270332336	0.015390493907034397	0.004083077423274517	0.01025819219648838	0.011683963239192963	0.009792761877179146	0.005014187190681696	0.007105441298335791	0.00659157196059823	0.010054768063127995	0.00213959370739758	0.006613582372665405	0.002422054298222065
relationships	401	i(m27 ) am redeveloping feelings for my long - term ex(f23 ) now that our breakup has skyrocketed my career . so here 's the situation : i(m27 ) had a very civil break up with my ex(f23 ) about 5 months ago because i felt i needed to be more selfish / focused on my career . i dated this girl for 5 years while going to college and working . she was an amazing gf , but she had some growing up to do , and i also did n't have the time for her working ft and school ft . we have the same large group of friends , so i still see her every week , and we are on really good terms . we even hang out one on one every once and a while with relative ease . after our breakup , my freedom to go out and network landed me an amazing job that has allowed me to drop out of school , and has opened some doors to a very lucrative career in a new state . during this time , i 've been dating a lot , but no one has come close to how i felt , and still feel with my ex . we still text a lot(more than we should according to our friends ) . i 'm still on good terms with her family(which is essentially my second family ) . and we still have a great time together . without a doubt , my general outlook on life has gone from miserable to ecstatic because of my new job and free time . this is making me wonder if things would have been different with us if i was in my current situation . however , i ca n't deny that the freedom of the breakup is the main reason i was able to land this job , and i will need to continue to network in order to maintain / advance in this career . i have the opportunity to move to a new state ( not far from our current state , and a very similar lifestyle ) . this would land me an even better paying job , and allow me more free time . i 've actually found myself considering trying to get her back and moving to the new state together , but i do n't know if that would stunt my career again . i have no clue what to do , and my friends are still too happy to see more of me to consider my point of view . i need a little outside insight . hopefully you all can help .	0.5833703875541687	0.26798611879348755	0.013416399247944355	0.0057290224358439445	0.010795122012495995	0.014508083462715149	0.010799950920045376	0.01491862628608942	0.006681521888822317	0.0166400745511055	0.023880204185843468	0.010945731773972511	0.00817161425948143	0.01215711236000061

relationships	303	"( 22 m ) as a lonely guy , how should i figure out if i really like someone instead of just enjoying their companionship ? this situation has happened to me before . i was quite lonely as a college freshman and got back together with my high school flame ( at the time a hs junior ) . however this relationship was predicated on my loneliness and when i did n't feel lonely i did n't care about her much at all . after a short second honeymoon we broke up again . now , after not dating for years and only having one drunken makeout in the meantime , i 'm hooking up with a girl i met on tinder ( f , 20 , three dates over twelve days ) . i lost my v - card to her last week and we have pleasant conversation / physics . this leads me to think i like her , but there are some problems present . other than having relatively similar musical tastes and senses of humor , we do n't really have much in common . she 's an art student while i 'm engineering . she 's indoorsy while i 'm outdoorsy . she does n't like physical activity while i 'm rabid . i 'm worried that after the honeymoon inevitably dries up we wo n't have anything to bond over and i wo n't really like her because i only connected with her out of loneliness . we are n't declared exclusive yet , but things seem to be headed in that direction with multiple long dates planned for the future . are my concerns well founded ? after we learn all about each other i do n't know if we 'll have much to talk about or do together . to maintain the relationship will we have to find / create substantial common interests ? i do n't get a lot of girls so it 's hard to accept that i just need to "" find another fish .

( no fear of that becoming a long term thing , as he has a roommate and i would not live with him and his roommate . ) there 's some value in taking an opportunity when it presents itself , especially when it comes to making so drastic of a life change that it could really , really benefit me financially ... but i am not so sure about the emotional ramifications of being in debt to a significant other , so to speak . we actually both see very eye to eye on this as far as the pros and cons are concerned , it has not caused any fights , no issues . curious for some feedback , is all . anyone here ever become employed due to the help of a so ? how did it turn out for you ? do you regret it ?	0.14711934328079224	0.6623408794403076	0.023038551211357117	0.010499435476958752	0.01740719936788082	0.006665018852800131	0.012954306788742542	0.008570180274546146	0.005640403833240271	0.037981610745191574	0.0404377281665802	0.007731350604444742	0.00532869528979063	0.014285308308899403

"" of course , i respect my girlfriend too much to act on those desires . yesterday i tried breaking up with her by bringing up some excuse about a potential possibility of a long distance relationship . the conversation we had made me think about how long we 've been together , how much i really like her , how committed she 's been since then and how special what we have is . every time i think about her cheating on me i get upset , every time a girl asks if i want to walk her home after a night of drinking i have second thoughts . i wish there was some way to say , "" hey you had your fun , i want mine and then we can get back together , "" but i know that is not realistic . i really do care about this girl and can see myself with her in the long run , but also wish i could have my time to do me . maybe its selfish , but that is honestly how i feel . advice or thoughts ?"	0.5027044415473938	0.4484891891479492	0.005979374051094055	0.002432875568047166	0.005178732797503471	0.004044991917908192	0.005434470716863871	0.003750900039449334	0.0020148660987615585	0.004600995220243931	0.009128976613283157	0.0016330088255926967	0.0016988851130008698	0.0029081988614052534
relationships	326	i 'm [ 23 m ] seeing a [ 23 f ] casually and she does n't seem interested in safe sex ! ! ! i 've been seeing this girl for about a month now , and we 've had sex multiple times . she 's had a very active sexual history , but she was recently tested and she 's clean apart from hpv . we are keeping it casual , which means we 're okay with each other sleeping with other people , but i still wanted to keep things safe . i asked her to use condoms when sleeping with other guys ( i always use a condom when having sex with her ) so that i could feel safe about this whole arrangement , but she protested . she takes birth control , and her logic is that she takes it for a reason - so she can have unprotected sex and not worry about pregnancy . i explained that my request was not because i was worried about pregnancy , but because i was worried about some random guy lying to her about being clean and giving her something nasty , therefore putting me at risk . she said it should n't matter anyway , since i use a condom , and i told her that condoms are great at protecting girls from guys but not so great the other way around ( simply due to the logistics of the whole thing ) . we 're planning to talk about this more , but i wanted to run it by you guys for some second opinions . am i being unreasonable by asking her to use condoms when sleeping with other guys ? she says she really dislikes the feeling of condoms and much prefers bareback , which i totally get , but they make super - thin condoms nowadays . i also get that she takes birth control for a reason , but i feel like this is a discussion about stis and not pregnancy at all . i do n't feel like birth control and condoms have anything to do with each other for the topic that i 'm concerned about ( stis ) .	0.850455641746521	0.013041182421147823	0.00970282219350338	0.0043391031213104725	0.009201865643262863	0.007755147758871317	0.01536883506923914	0.004290801007300615	0.0036881014239042997	0.014872298575937748	0.043148741126060486	0.007094424217939377	0.003032743465155363	0.014008337631821632

relationships	340	update : boyfriend [ 28 m ] asked me [ 23f ] to stop rock climbing . who 's right ? original post :* * first off - a blanket thank you to all the reassurances that i 'm not a blind asshole . i read every comment , but did n't have the time to reply to each one individually . so , i met up with boyfriend again and told him that while i will not quit rock climbing i want to try and make him more comfortable . i offered to buy him a day pass to the gym so that he could see what it 's like , even though he ca n't climb , but he said he did n't want to go . when i pressed him , he admitted to feeling self conscious lately because he 's been gaining weight since his injury ( torn acl ) . apparently this got worse a few weeks ago when he heard a friend and i being jealous over how hot everyone at the gym is ( we ca n't seem to develop visible abs ) . i tried to reassure him that he was attractive , but do n't know how successful i was . i told him i 'd put overnight trips on hold until he heals and can come with . so no yosemite , but i 've been waiting long enough anyway so i figure a few more months is n't a big deal . he agreed that changing my couple 's membership was unnecessary , but suggested switching to a nearby university gym with a climbing wall when it 's over . i told him i did n't want to because their gym is out of the way , super expensive , and their climbing wall is small . plus , i * like * my gym and the people there . he was miffed but let it go . i think he might bring it up again when my membership is up - but that 's still a few months away so i 'll cross that bridge then . if anyone has ideas on how to make him feel more attractive despite the weight gain , i 'm all ears ! i 'm thinking maybe a special date night so he knows i 'm happy being with him .	0.00958038680255413	0.8853024244308472	0.014190423302352428	0.006656249985098839	0.012963390909135342	0.008685016073286533	0.010768652893602848	0.006544905249029398	0.005310884211212397	0.010526081547141075	0.013886203989386559	0.003715003840625286	0.006297668442130089	0.005572757683694363

( x and i are okay socially ) . part of me thinks if a woman likes you , she would n't want to invite his ex around . i 'm certain i 've been friend zoned . any sliver of chance , men and women of reddit ?	0.6191888451576233	0.22734054923057556	0.027685273438692093	0.006443504709750414	0.016223913058638573	0.007501948159188032	0.01375439390540123	0.007340640295296907	0.02788226678967476	0.008799639530479908	0.011059378273785114	0.006577109452337027	0.011512888595461845	0.008689577691257

"" i thought that was the end of it so i walked away . this was about a week ago and she refuses to speak to me or acknowledge my presence or anything i say to her . i know i was being kind of snobby because i was tired , and i do n't think walking away from her when she was angry at me helped either , but because she wo n't acknowledge me or talk to me i ca n't even speak to her without her closing her door in my face or interrupting what i 'm saying by talking to her dog . this is the first time this has ever happened between us and i have no idea what to do to fix this situation . she 's taking this situation and making it into a way bigger deal than i think it should be , and because of this i have no idea what to do to make it better or how to even apologize to her . i want to talk to my sister again and for things to be okay but i really do n't understand how it got this bad . because she 's ignoring me i ca n't apologize by saying anything to her ."	0.7412417531013489	0.08042608201503754	0.013823551125824451	0.013028373010456562	0.022935066372156143	0.016340455040335655	0.017324114218354225	0.01677713729441166	0.006355651654303074	0.010765798389911652	0.02011011727154255	0.015685543417930603	0.009004209190607071	0.016182254999876022
relationships	322	love my [ 20f ] girlfriend but struggling with misogyny [ 22 m ] so i have been struggling with this since my childhood , which was n't particularly nice because my father was quite abusive towards my mother , after 11 years old myself and my brother was just raised by her , and i remember this issue being present before then , however my mother was great to us and never treated us badly like my father did . the first time i noticed it was watching the original jurassic park with my best friend , i would have been about 9 or 10 years old , i remember wishing that the main woman in it would get killed the whole movie because so many guys had already , this trend continued and still does continue today . for a more modern example , when i read about false rape claims and girls saying they will get guys put away for rape when nothing happened etc that makes me hate women so much and fills me with anger . on the flip side , i get so jealous too because of the ease i see my female friends have with getting boyfriends / sex and the very little amount of pressure they are under when it comes to sexual things , as society puts such huge pressure on the guys involved and nothing on the girl . this would n't be good if i was single but atleast then it would n't complicate my life too much , but i do have a girlfriend , a girl i love with all my heart and the best girlfriend i ve ever had , i hold none of these grudges personally to her , but can not distract myself from the fact that her gender as a whole makes me mad , sad and jealous . do n't really know what to do or what else there is to say , just want to be able to love her and be with her without having all this negativity surrounding my mind .	0.6761026382446289	0.03741055354475975	0.03593829646706581	0.0132514126598835	0.0534990020096302	0.025786401703953743	0.016493093222379684	0.027864687144756317	0.026888510212302208	0.026503197848796844	0.03351810574531555	0.009089412167668343	0.006494084373116493	0.011160620488226414

( she 's always been a fan of foreplay ) it seems like she just misses me a lot and she says that she still loves , cares for me etc and that "" i 'm still hers "" in her mind but she does nt want a relationship i guess . as of yesterday we agreed to compromise . we agreed upon friends with benefits but completely faithful to each other . that is pretty much a relationship without the title ...... she obviously does nt want anyone else and is nt really trying to move on . i know the distance is a big deal but could it just be the physical part of our relationship that she needs to be reminded of ? i am so confused . oh yeah and i 'm also going to visit twice for about a week over the next 3 months our relationship will still be distance . i 'm flying in on valentines day . any advice or tips or anything is welcome . brutal honesty is appreciated as well . thanks !"	0.6130401492118835	0.2685774564743042	0.008562657982110977	0.0024874473456293344	0.010034454986453056	0.01653316617012024	0.01094661746174097	0.0045318882912397385	0.002905926201492548	0.027872899547219276	0.022821731865406036	0.002444021636620164	0.002702816389501095	0.006538755726069212

relationships	395	i [ 15 m ] do n't know how to stop thinking irrationally about an upcoming trip hi /r / relationships ! you 've all come through before with great advice , and here i am asking for help again . i will be going on a trip to a convention in may . i was the app developer for the convention , and therefore the organization took care of my expenses for me including my flight , hotel stay , and admission . i was really looking forward to go since it would be great time away from family and my surroundings and i could relax with my friends that are also going for a few days . i had my booking taken care of a few months ago and i 'm ready to go . the convention is coming up very soon . the problem is , my family decided to make random plans to go at the last minute . they decided this about a week or two ago when my mom 's best friend said that she was going too . i really do n't know what to think . my family can do whatever they want to do , and i should n't care what they do , but i 'm just not sure if my reaction with mixed feelings is appropriate . as far as they are concerned , i do n't have to change my plans to accommodate for them , and i 'm going completely separately . i am flying out versus driving with them , and i get my own room . i do n't have to do anything special just because they are also coming . i am told that this would n't be any different than if i went alone . at the same time , i 'm a bit disappointed . i wanted to have a few days to myself without having to be surrounded with my family . it can get slightly tiring to be around the same people every single day . i am sure my feelings of slight disappointment is irrational . i do n't have to make any concessions for them coming , and i have n't expressed negativity to them since i do n't want to cause problems and i do n't want to be a douchebag to my family . at the same time , i am a bit sad that my plan to be away from my family for a bit is not going to happen . reddit , what should i do ? how do i stop being upset about something which would probably work itself out ?	0.46274834871292114	0.3007318079471588	0.023453325033187866	0.012137566693127155	0.01968453638255596	0.045534148812294006	0.02680838108062744	0.02276036888360977	0.014966398477554321	0.014372255653142929	0.008065815083682537	0.018757645040750504	0.016794590279459953	0.013184793293476105

self	372	"do you think this is bait and switch ? i recently ordered a phone from a buy.com marketplace seller . it looked to have a pricing error but i went ahead and placed an order in case it was n't or they would honor it . i have no problem if they emailed me and said "" sorry , we made a mistake and have to cancel your order "" . they instead told me that they sold out and were ordering more to fulfill all the orders that were placed and would ship it when they got it . they called several times keeping me updated which was very nice . between the time they talked to me and it was shipped the phone came back on sale for the same price for 2 - 3 days . it is now halfway to me on the delivery truck and they called me to say there was a problem . in a rush to ship the orders as quickly as possible they did not look at the phone and the vendor sent them a much cheaper phone instead of my phone ( the normal price for the cheap phone is the same price as they had for the phone i ordered , same brand ) . they also told me the cheaper phone was pretty much the same as the other phone just smaller ( camera was about half as good , almost no internal memory , screen was worse , did n't handle as many formats , etc ) . they said i could either keep that phone for the same price or get a full refund . i said i wish to get the phone i ordered . they stated that was impossible because none of their vendors offer the phone in question . so , of course , i said i wanted a refund . the reason i am posting here is that i do not wish to just post such damning feedback even though i am a little upset over it . if they do n't refund 100 % of my money i can contact buy.com or even my credit card so that should n't be an issue . i just do n't want others to fall prey to them if this is an actual scam . do you think buy.com would investigate it since it would also look bad on them ?"	0.18783073127269745	0.26194170117378235	0.07836228609085083	0.028108956292271614	0.08144193142652512	0.03135097399353981	0.06042053550481796	0.04096478596329689	0.035993821918964386	0.025955239310860634	0.04118625447154045	0.03376472368836403	0.036311790347099304	0.05636625364422798
self	388	just a story about an ex that i had to get off my chest ( xpost from an askreddit comment ) i was manipulated into doing stuff with an ex who was currently with my once best friend . i lost this friend when the girl started dating and he lost his shit and blamed me for it . anywhore we where hanging out one day at my house and she tells me that she is still sexually attracted to me . thinking with my dick i see this as a great thing . stuff happens and then i realize that she is still with her current boyfriend . i freak out and tell her that she has to come clean ( because they guy would never believe me and kick my ass ) . she convinces me to keep everything to myself ( looking back on it i should have said fuck you and told him right away . ) and that it was okay . a couple days later we are at my house again working on a project and she starts coming on to me . she tells me that she likes me a lot so i assumed that she was gon na dump him and things would be okay . long story short stuff happens and a week later she is still with him . at this point i freak the fuck out and realize that i 'm an awful person for doing this and she freaks and tells him . only she lied and say that it was all my fault and that nothing serious happened and that it only happened once . i was unaware of this . then the guy messages me and tells me this . so i go and tell the girl what the fuck then go tell the guy everything that happened . he is still totally convinced that it is still all my fault and that this girl is 100 % innocent . the weird part is she would have sex with me but she would nt do more than kiss him . bottom line is that she * really * fucked with me ( pun intended ) and my emotions and i m so glad that cunt is out of my life ! oh and they are still together and i m waiting for him to realize what she will do to get her way and tells me that i was right . oh highschool you crazy .	0.6885033845901489	0.08702238649129868	0.04191737622022629	0.014823450706899166	0.018784698098897934	0.015275105834007263	0.014837382361292839	0.015009189024567604	0.011596092954277992	0.026125116273760796	0.02942318096756935	0.013367139734327793	0.01087307371199131	0.012442427687346935
self	223	here 's why you should never buy mid grade gasoline . if you put mid grade gas / petrol in your car , pay close attention to the price and octane and do some quick math . [ here 's a photo ] of the pump near my house . we 'll use it as an example . it lists 87 octane for $ 1.899 it lists 89 octane for $ 2.099 it lists 93 octane for $ 2.259 if we make 2 separate number lines you 'll see a simple visual for how they typically price the 3 grades . for simplicity , i 'm adding .001 to each value to remove the 3rd decimal . --**87**----88 - ---**89**----90 - ---91 - ---92 - ---**93**-- as you can see , the jump in octane between mid and premium is twice the jump in octane between regular and mid.(4 points vs 2 points ) --**$1.90**--$1.95 - -$2.00 - -$2.05 - -**$2.10**--$2.15 - -$2.20 - --**$2.26**-- while the price , on the other hand , jumps more between regular and mid than between mid and premium ( 20 cents vs 16 cents ) this means that if you mix half a tank of regular with half a tank of premium , you 'll pay less than mid and get a higher octane than mid . it takes an extra minute at the pump to complete 2 transactions instead of one , but i 've been able to find stations that do n't have delays between transactions and can shave that time down to ~10 seconds with a credit card .	0.09893345087766647	0.1615183800458908	0.1178821250796318	0.03606214001774788	0.12974582612514496	0.05184229090809822	0.09526798874139786	0.051133785396814346	0.05161706358194351	0.01829371601343155	0.030470238998532295	0.02876770682632923	0.05348080024123192	0.07498442381620407

I'd hit a plateau the last four weeks or so where I was stuck at 222. Felt like kind of a bummer, but knew it's because I haven't been as strict as I should with my diet, and the last week and a half have been crazy with life things, so I haven't been exercising as frequently as I've gotten used to. When I weighed myself as normal on Monday, I was kind of disappointed to see the scale not budging and figured it was time to buckle down again and really watch my diet. Today was my measure-in day, and I've felt cruddy in general since Monday because I caught some chest congestion/cold bug over the weekend. I get on the scale...it says 219. Whaaaaat? I take my measurements, which are down slightly from last month, and with an total-body loss of 8 inches from my starting point on 12/23/14! Some of my clothes have been feeling a bit looser as of late and now I know it's just not in my head. I'm now the lightest and smallest I've been since right around high school!\\nTL;DR:</td>\n",

How have you dealt with them, particularly the ones that you can't hide?\\n\\nI'm not currently in a relationship, but recently I've realized that there is someone who likes me, and I'm interested in them, too. Frankly, the only reason I'm not asking them out is because I know that I have some insecurities that need to be worked through - particularly in the realm of body image. While I'm confident in the rest of my body, I've had terrible, awful acne both on my arms and breasts since I was very young. It's a special type with no complete cure, but doctors suggested that I keep my skin oiled until it goes away (dryness irritates it). Because of this it's not so much present anymore as large clusters of scars are.\\n\\nWould I warn someone about this upfront before anything sexual? Would I just let it surprise them when the clothes come off? Do I tell them \"Let's keep on my shirt for now\" while we do our business? \\n\\nHave you had experiences with anything similar?

One private loan at 9.5% (highest priority obviously) and nine others federal between 3.4% and 6.8%. Minimum payment per month total is $301.16. Over the next 9 months, I will pay off $11k of these, which will get rid of everything above 5% interest and will drop the total minimum payment to $150. \\n\\nAt the end of the 9 months, our savings will be around $35k. At that time my husband will need to purchase a car so some of that will be his down payment. So more realistically $25-30k. \\n\\nSometime in the future, between a year to two years from now, my husband and I may be moving. Typical single family homes in this area go for around $300k. \\n\\nAt the end of the 9 months, should I continue to focus on paying down student debt (which will be a balance of $14k by then) or growing our savings/down payment?

She'll come over and clean my apartment, do laundry, dishes and cook for me, even as far as to offer oral favors while I'm drinking a beer! \\n\\nShe seems completely happy and content during this time, which makes me happy and I naturally want to do things back for her. As soon as I start doing her favors, she picks fights and complains nonstop. Latest issue was I offered to take her and her mom to dinner. She kept giving me shit about how I'm going to be spending too much time with my brother (who's visiting for a week soon), which she was totally fine with when I was being distant with her. She'll call me a bitch in a joking way, and just take the piss out of me whenever I'm kind or go out of my way to apologize. \\n\\nThis naturally makes me feel cold and indifferent toward her. Once she senses that, she's all about making me the happiest boyfriend and apologizes for all the shit she was giving me the week previously. It's a vicious cycle but I'm not sure what to do here. I've brought this up with her and she recognizes it and has no solution. She just \"feels differently towards me sometimes\" and can't explain it.\\n\\n**So what do I do here?

Felt like kind of a bummer, but knew it's because I haven't been as strict as I should with my diet, and the last week and a half have been crazy with life things, so I haven't been exercising as frequently as I've gotten used to. When I weighed myself as normal on Monday, I was kind of disappointed to see the scale not budging and figured it was time to buckle down again and really watch my diet. Today was my measure-in day, and I've felt cruddy in general since Monday because I caught some chest congestion/cold bug over the weekend. I get on the scale...it says 219. Whaaaaat? I take my measurements, which are down slightly from last month, and with an total-body loss of 8 inches from my starting point on 12/23/14! Some of my clothes have been feeling a bit looser as of late and now I know it's just not in my head. I'm now the lightest and smallest I've been since right around high school!\\nTL;DR:    \n",

How have you dealt with them, particularly the ones that you can't hide?\\n\\nI'm not currently in a relationship, but recently I've realized that there is someone who likes me, and I'm interested in them, too. Frankly, the only reason I'm not asking them out is because I know that I have some insecurities that need to be worked through - particularly in the realm of body image. While I'm confident in the rest of my body, I've had terrible, awful acne both on my arms and breasts since I was very young. It's a special type with no complete cure, but doctors suggested that I keep my skin oiled until it goes away (dryness irritates it). Because of this it's not so much present anymore as large clusters of scars are.\\n\\nWould I warn someone about this upfront before anything sexual? Would I just let it surprise them when the clothes come off? Do I tell them \"Let's keep on my shirt for now\" while we do our business? \\n\\nHave you had experiences with anything similar?

She'll come over and clean my apartment, do laundry, dishes and cook for me, even as far as to offer oral favors while I'm drinking a beer! \\n\\nShe seems completely happy and content during this time, which makes me happy and I naturally want to do things back for her. As soon as I start doing her favors, she picks fights and complains nonstop. Latest issue was I offered to take her and her mom to dinner. She kept giving me shit about how I'm going to be spending too much time with my brother (who's visiting for a week soon), which she was totally fine with when I was being distant with her. She'll call me a bitch in a joking way, and just take the piss out of me whenever I'm kind or go out of my way to apologize. \\n\\nThis naturally makes me feel cold and indifferent toward her. Once she senses that, she's all about making me the happiest boyfriend and apologizes for all the shit she was giving me the week previously. It's a vicious cycle but I'm not sure what to do here. I've brought this up with her and she recognizes it and has no solution. She just \"feels differently towards me sometimes\" and can't explain it.\\n\\n**So what do I do here?

No one wants to be alone on a floor by themselves with the kitchen and living room and if people are pre drinking, coming into the kitchen you'll be in the room next door. Every room is en-suite except the 2 in the attic which share. No one wants the basement and people don't want but don't mind the attic. It's 2 guys and 8 girls in my house and we agree that 2 girls will take the attic as they work together  and hang out a lot.     \\n    \\nEventually we decide to draw names and numbers out of a hat for rooms is the most fair method. One of the more vocal girls gets the basement and declares that she refuses to go into that room. She states that \"as a girl\" she doesn't want to be alone on the floor, it's scary for a girl to be there, any noise would scare you. Also the fact that she (and 2 other girls) found the house after going to a few viewings is stated as why its unfair.     \\n    \\nAs I expected, they turn to the other guy and myself, requesting we swap. Us lads should be there, it's too scary. However if the house was all girls, someone would have that room. I don't want the room for the same reason as everyone else, I don't want to be isolated and and next to the kitchen. We discuss this for a good half hour but me and the other guy don't change our minds.    \\n    \\nI'd say we're both nice guys so it's almost expected we'd take the worse room but on this instance I feel like I have to stand my ground. If we let them bully us with the majority they'll be doing it all of next year. The room isn't even near the front door so it can't be that scary and regardless of it being the 'gentlemanly' thing to do the rooms were picked fairly and it's unfair on us to expect us to swap just because we're the two guys in the house.

How do I make new friends reddit?\\nPOST: Ok, Ill give you the low down. \\n\\nI was fairly popular in school always surrounded by friends, but as we all left for university my friendship group separated dramatically. I took 2 gap years and worked as a Teaching assistant.  All of my co-workers were older and well.. teachers so I didn't have much of a social life from there.\\n\\nI then went to Uni again, tonnes of friends until I had to leave due to family shit and stress. My friends are still there. \\n\\nI haven't been able to go and visit, as I've started a new job (last sept). I work as part of a team of 6 , in estate. My co-workers are nice but not my couple of tea. Plus they have a friendship group established, and In a commission based job, nobody is really your friend anyway.\\n\\nLastly, My best friend has been with me for 6 years. We made the horrible horrible horrible mistake of hooking up 3 month ago and she broke up with me last night, so she could be single.. Turns out shes back with her ex.... yep. \\n\\nSo. In a world where I now feel like I have no friends. How do I start to rebuild my circle?\\n\\nThanks,\\nTL;DR:    \n",

This might not be a long time, plus we live in different countries and never once touched each other during this whole relationship, yet I feel broken and she is worse. I talked to her best friend who is really mad at me(understandable of course) and she says that Lucy(my girlfriend) is really in love with me and right now she is a mess; angry, sad, frustrated, betrayed, confused and unloved.\\nI get all of that and I feel like the worst human being there is for doing that to her. I still care so much for her and knowing I just kinda destroyed her made me cry all day so far.\\nThe reason I broke up with her is that I no longer saw a future for us together. Not without her or me changing, and I also realized I didnt really want to change for her... \\nDoes anyone have any idea how I can make this easier for her? What is the best thing I can do right now? I dont need advice for myself, I started this and I feel like I deserve to feel the way I do. But I want to make this easier for her, and I dont know how...\\nTL;DR:    \n",
       "3  SUBREDDIT: r/Advice\\nTITLE: Disagreement when picking rooms in the new house\\nPOST: My house next year has one basement room no one wants as it's on a floor by itself and next to the kitchen. No one wants to be alone on a floor by themselves with the kitchen and living room and if people are pre drinking, coming into the kitchen you'll be in the room next door. Every room is en-suite except the 2 in the attic which share. No one wants the basement and people don't want but don't mind the attic. It's 2 guys and 8 girls in my house and we agree that 2 girls will take the attic as they work together  and hang out a lot.     \\n    \\nEventually we decide to draw names and numbers out of a hat for rooms is the most fair method. One of the more vocal girls gets the basement and declares that she refuses to go into that room. She states that \"as a girl\" she doesn't want to be alone on the floor, it's scary for a girl to be there, any noise would scare you. Also the fact that she (and 2 other girls) found the house after going to a few viewings is stated as why its unfair.     \\n    \\nAs I expected, they turn to the other guy and myself, requesting we swap. Us lads should be there, it's too scary. However if the house was all girls, someone would have that room. I don't want the room for the same reason as everyone else, I don't want to be isolated and and next to the kitchen. We discuss this for a good half hour but me and the other guy don't change our minds.    \\n    \\nI'd say we're both nice guys so it's almost expected we'd take the worse room but on this instance I feel like I have to stand my ground. If we let them bully us with the majority they'll be doing it all of next year. The room isn't even near the front door so it can't be that scary and regardless of it being the 'gentlemanly' thing to do the rooms were picked fairly and it's unfair on us to expect us to swap just because we're the two guys in the house. Am I doing the right thing here by not swapping or am I being selfish?\\nTL;DR:    \n",

This might not be a long time, plus we live in different countries and never once touched each other during this whole relationship, yet I feel broken and she is worse. I talked to her best friend who is really mad at me(understandable of course) and she says that Lucy(my girlfriend) is really in love with me and right now she is a mess; angry, sad, frustrated, betrayed, confused and unloved. I get all of that and I feel like the worst human being there is for doing that to her. I still care so much for her and knowing I just kinda destroyed her made me cry all day so far. The reason I broke up with her is that I no longer saw a future for us together. Not without her or me changing, and I also realized I didnt really want to change for her... Does anyone have any idea how I can make this easier for her? What is the best thing I can do right now? I dont need advice for myself, I started this and I feel like I deserve to feel the way I do. But I want to make this easier for her, and I dont know how...</td>\n",

       "      <td>Disagreement when picking rooms in the new house My house next year has one basement room no one wants as it's on a floor by itself and next to the kitchen. No one wants to be alone on a floor by themselves with the kitchen and living room and if people are pre drinking, coming into the kitchen you'll be in the room next door. Every room is en-suite except the 2 in the attic which share. No one wants the basement and people don't want but don't mind the attic. It's 2 guys and 8 girls in my house and we agree that 2 girls will take the attic as they work together and hang out a lot. Eventually we decide to draw names and numbers out of a hat for rooms is the most fair method. One of the more vocal girls gets the basement and declares that she refuses to go into that room. She states that \"as a girl\" she doesn't want to be alone on the floor, it's scary for a girl to be there, any noise would scare you. Also the fact that she (and 2 other girls) found the house after going to a few viewings is stated as why its unfair. As I expected, they turn to the other guy and myself, requesting we swap. Us lads should be there, it's too scary. However if the house was all girls, someone would have that room. I don't want the room for the same reason as everyone else, I don't want to be isolated and and next to the kitchen. We discuss this for a good half hour but me and the other guy don't change our minds. I'd say we're both nice guys so it's almost expected we'd take the worse room but on this instance I feel like I have to stand my ground. If we let them bully us with the majority they'll be doing it all of next year. The room isn't even near the front door so it can't be that scary and regardless of it being the 'gentlemanly' thing to do the rooms were picked fairly and it's unfair on us to expect us to swap just because we're the two guys in the house. Am I doing the right thing here by not swapping or am I being selfish?</td>\n",

After not being able to shake it, I would like some advice. I came to the realization that I don't have any values that I hold close. I don't know what I believe in. I don't know where I reside politically, I don't have a clue. How can I be almost 20 years old and so uninformed. I feel as if everything has my attention for a limited time before I see or hear the next new thing. I can't stop, think, and internalize anything. It's somewhat alarming because I'm starting to realize that my whole life has been this way. Is it because I'm young and impressionable? I want to have strong, defined values that I essentially demonstrate and live by every day. I want to know everything but it's not possible which is saddening. I question reality every day and constantly ponder what is true in our world. Everything is skewed. The news reports, politicians, and corporate industry? Who tells the truth? How do I know who is right? Or are we all wrong? Too many possibilities have me spinning in circles and I feel stuck.</td>\n",

I don't want to get into specifics, but I've been working in my field for over 6 years. I've accomplished a lot, I've been recognized as good at what I do by superiors and coworkers and I've got a lot of accomplishments and things I've done that should make me more confident and secure, but I still feel nervous, unprepared and anxious before work. I can't explain it, but I feel anxious and nervous every day before work and during the day even though I should feel comfortable and confident. I love what I do, but I always feel anxious or someone is going to tell me I'm doing a bad job, even though this has never happened.  \n",

This might not be a long time, plus we live in different countries and never once touched each other during this whole relationship, yet I feel broken and she is worse. I talked to her best friend who is really mad at me(understandable of course) and she says that Lucy(my girlfriend) is really in love with me and right now she is a mess; angry, sad, frustrated, betrayed, confused and unloved. I get all of that and I feel like the worst human being there is for doing that to her. I still care so much for her and knowing I just kinda destroyed her made me cry all day so far. The reason I broke up with her is that I no longer saw a future for us together. Not without her or me changing, and I also realized I didnt really want to change for her... Does anyone have any idea how I can make this easier for her? What is the best thing I can do right now? I dont need advice for myself, I started this and I feel like I deserve to feel the way I do. But I want to make this easier for her, and I dont know how...  \n",
       "3  Disagreement when picking rooms in the new house My house next year has one basement room no one wants as it's on a floor by itself and next to the kitchen. No one wants to be alone on a floor by themselves with the kitchen and living room and if people are pre drinking, coming into the kitchen you'll be in the room next door. Every room is en-suite except the 2 in the attic which share. No one wants the basement and people don't want but don't mind the attic. It's 2 guys and 8 girls in my house and we agree that 2 girls will take the attic as they work together and hang out a lot. Eventually we decide to draw names and numbers out of a hat for rooms is the most fair method. One of the more vocal girls gets the basement and declares that she refuses to go into that room. She states that \"as a girl\" she doesn't want to be alone on the floor, it's scary for a girl to be there, any noise would scare you. Also the fact that she (and 2 other girls) found the house after going to a few viewings is stated as why its unfair. As I expected, they turn to the other guy and myself, requesting we swap. Us lads should be there, it's too scary. However if the house was all girls, someone would have that room. I don't want the room for the same reason as everyone else, I don't want to be isolated and and next to the kitchen. We discuss this for a good half hour but me and the other guy don't change our minds. I'd say we're both nice guys so it's almost expected we'd take the worse room but on this instance I feel like I have to stand my ground. If we let them bully us with the majority they'll be doing it all of next year. The room isn't even near the front door so it can't be that scary and regardless of it being the 'gentlemanly' thing to do the rooms were picked fairly and it's unfair on us to expect us to swap just because we're the two guys in the house. Am I doing the right thing here by not swapping or am I being selfish?  \n",

After not being able to shake it, I would like some advice. I came to the realization that I don't have any values that I hold close. I don't know what I believe in. I don't know where I reside politically, I don't have a clue. How can I be almost 20 years old and so uninformed. I feel as if everything has my attention for a limited time before I see or hear the next new thing. I can't stop, think, and internalize anything. It's somewhat alarming because I'm starting to realize that my whole life has been this way. Is it because I'm young and impressionable? I want to have strong, defined values that I essentially demonstrate and live by every day. I want to know everything but it's not possible which is saddening. I question reality every day and constantly ponder what is true in our world. Everything is skewed. The news reports, politicians, and corporate industry? Who tells the truth? How do I know who is right? Or are we all wrong? Too many possibilities have me spinning in circles and I feel stuck.  "

       "3  disagreement when picking rooms in the new house my house next year has one basement room no one wants as it 's on a floor by itself and next to the kitchen . no one wants to be alone on a floor by themselves with the kitchen and living room and if people are pre drinking , coming into the kitchen you 'll be in the room next door . every room is en - suite except the 2 in the attic which share . no one wants the basement and people do n't want but do n't mind the attic . it 's 2 guys and 8 girls in my house and we agree that 2 girls will take the attic as they work together and hang out a lot . eventually we decide to draw names and numbers out of a hat for rooms is the most fair method . one of the more vocal girls gets the basement and declares that she refuses to go into that room . she states that \" as a girl \" she does n't want to be alone on the floor , it 's scary for a girl to be there , any noise would scare you . also the fact that she ( and 2 other girls ) found the house after going to a few viewings is stated as why its unfair . as i expected , they turn to the other guy and myself , requesting we swap . us lads should be there , it 's too scary . however if the house was all girls , someone would have that room . i do n't want the room for the same reason as everyone else , i do n't want to be isolated and and next to the kitchen . we discuss this for a good half hour but me and the other guy do n't change our minds . i 'd say we 're both nice guys so it 's almost expected we 'd take the worse room but on this instance i feel like i have to stand my ground . if we let them bully us with the majority they 'll be doing it all of next year . the room is n't even near the front door so it ca n't be that scary and regardless of it being the ' gentlemanly ' thing to do the rooms were picked fairly and it 's unfair on us to expect us to swap just because we 're the two guys in the house . am i doing the right thing here by not swapping or am i being selfish ?  \n",
